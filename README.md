#Blue, simple programming language[C++ compiler.]

Welcome to the Blue programming language compiler repository. This project serves as a learning resource to understand the fundamentals of how compilers work, using the Blue language as an example. Blue is a simple programming language designed for my own learning experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the BlueCompiler up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your Linux system:

- NASM
- LD (Linker)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the BlueCompiler repository
git clone https://github.com/zbluee/blue-compiler.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd blue-compiler

# Create a build directory
mkdir build

# Configure the build using CMake
cmake -S . -B build

# Build the BlueCompiler executable
cmake --build build

```
# About
I'm creating this as a simple learning project to understand how compilers work. I hope that, with time and contributions, Blue will evolve into a more substantial programming language.
